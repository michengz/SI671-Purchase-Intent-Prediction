# SI671-Purchase-Intent-Prediction
Data Mining Course Final Project @ University of Michigan
## Introduction
With the prevalence of web tracking tools and services, e-commerce platforms are capable of keeping records of extensive user behavioral data beyond just traditional information. This project aims to explore methods for processing clickstream data to predict whether a given user path will result in a successful purchase. Early prediction of purchases and drop-offs enables companies to target campaigns and promotions more accurately in real-time, and can provide insights into improving user experiences on specific webpages to increase engagement. A few research questions that were explored throughout the project include:
1. Are we able to predict purchase intent at an early stage of a user session? What is the minimum length of clickstream sequence required to make acceptable predictions?
2. Can Sequence Modeling on clickstream data outperform common feature-based classification models?
3. How does the level of interaction (e.g. page-level, event-level) affect prediction performances? Does categorization of pageviews help with improving performance?
